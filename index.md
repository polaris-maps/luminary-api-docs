People with disabilities face numerous obstacles to accessing campus activities in the form of physical barriers (ex. stairs, broken elevators, steep inclines, sidewalk blockages) and knowledge barriers (e.g. lack of information on accessibility equipment status, confusing signage for accessible routes). This project aims to address knowledge barriers around campus route-finding by crowdsourcing information on obstacles to suggest routes customized to the needs of the specific user.
